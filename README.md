# recipe-finder

explanation:

API Request:

The get_recipes function sends a GET request to the Spoonacular API with the given ingredients and retrieves a list of recipes.
GUI Setup:

We create the main window using tkinter and add input fields for entering ingredients.
A button is added to trigger the search for recipes.
A text box displays the search results.
Search Recipes:

The search_recipes function gets the input ingredients, validates them, fetches recipes using the get_recipes function, and then displays them.
Display Recipes:

The display_recipes function formats and displays the recipe results in the text box.
Running the Code:
Save the code into a Python script file (e.g., recipe_finder.py).
Run the script using a Python interpreter (python recipe_finder.py).
Enter ingredients in the input field, separated by commas, and click "Search Recipes" to see the results.
Enhancements:
Detailed Recipe Information:

Fetch and display more detailed information about each recipe, such as instructions, preparation time, and nutritional information.
Error Handling:

Add more robust error handling for network issues, API rate limits, and invalid responses.
Improved UI:

Enhance the user interface with better styling, input validation, and additional features like saving favorite recipes or filtering results.
This project demonstrates how to integrate a third-party API, handle user input, and create a simple but functional GUI application. It provides a solid foundation for building more advanced features and learning new concepts.
